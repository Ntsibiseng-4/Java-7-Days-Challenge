# 7-Day Java Beginner Challenge

This repository contains my personal journey of learning Java through a 7-day self-imposed challenge. Each day I tackled a different foundational topic in Java, followed simple tasks, and completed mini challenges to reinforce what I learned.

---

## Why This Challenge?

I wanted to stay consistent, build a strong foundation in Java, and gain hands-on practice by writing code every day. This challenge helped me focus on one topic at a time, from writing a simple "Hello World" program to building a basic student grade system by Day 7.

---

## What I Covered Each Day

### Day 1: Java Basics & Hello World
- Set up Java and my IDE
- Wrote my first `main()` method
- Printed messages using `System.out.println()`

**Mini Challenge**: Printed my name and favorite quote.

---

### Day 2: Variables and Data Types
- Learned about `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, and `String`
- Stored and printed different types of data

**Mini Challenge**: Created a program that prints my age, height, and student status.

---

### Day 3: Conditionals (if, else, else if)
- Practiced using `if`, `else`, and `else if`
- Compared values with operators like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`

**Mini Challenge**: Determined age category (child, teen, adult) based on input.

---

### Day 4: Loops (for, while)
- Wrote `for` loops and `while` loops
- Used loops to repeat logic

**Mini Challenge**: Printed all even numbers from 1 to 50.

---

### Day 5: Methods (Functions)
- Wrote methods using `static void` and methods with return values
- Passed arguments and worked with return types

**Mini Challenge**: Created a method that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

---

### Day 6: Arrays
- Declared and initialized arrays
- Used loops to access and print array elements

**Mini Challenge**: Created an array of numbers and printed each number with its square.

---

### Day 7: Mini Project â€“ Student Grade System ðŸŽ“
- Combined everything I learned into a small application
- Used methods, arrays, conditionals, and input handling

**Mini Challenge**: Created a program that takes a studentâ€™s marks and prints their grade (A, B, C, etc.)

---

## Reflections

This challenge taught me:
- How to break down concepts into small achievable goals
- That consistency is more important than perfection
- How to build confidence by practicing and solving problems
